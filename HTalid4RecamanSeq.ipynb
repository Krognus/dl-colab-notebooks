        "RF is just low frequency light. It behaves in a similar way to light being refracted and reflected.  The effects scale with wavelength, but you can get exactly the same effects in mirrors, blocks of transparent (to light or RF) material, lenses and waveguides (or light fibers) with RF and light or infra-red.  The scale difference is huge.  Light is around 0.5 of a micrometer wavelength, microwaves are a few centimeters, AM radio is perhaps 300 meters wavelength.  They can all be treated as waves or as photons, and quantum mechanics applies just the same to them all. When you put a pencil in a fishtank, it seems to bend. That same refraction happens with radio waves, they travel more slowly in dielectrics than in a vacuum because of the quantum effects, but that doesn't matter for large objects like these. A slanting dielectric surface can bend the rays of light or radio energy.  If the slanted surface is in the shape of a curved magnifying glass, the amount of bending varies across the glass, with more bending at the edges, so a parallel beam of light like from the Sun gets focussed to a point.  Exactly the same happens with radio waves so long as the glass is more than ten wavelengths across and the source is emitting radio waves.  You might want to use PTFE or a similar RF-transparent plastic to make the lens as it's much clearer than glass at millimeter wavelengths. At Infra red around 10 micrometers wavelength, Germanium metal lenses work well as they are transparent to IR, as is Calcium Fluoride.\n",

        "OK, so we are halfway.  Now instead of making the lens shaped like a magnifying glass, we can change the density of the material by putting larger holes (or more holes) in it to reduce its average density, varying that density across the body of the material.  If you pick the rate of change of density just right, the effect on mmWave energy is indistinguishable from that of the original magnifying glass shape, but it's way easier to make and mount.  You can also do really complex tapers of density that would be impossible to machine.  That's the benefit of this technology, it takes us way beyond what can be done with casting, injection molding, electroforming, laser cutting, water jets, Wire EDM or CNC machining, at least for ceramic-filled photopolymers.\n",

        "RF is just low frequency light. It behaves in a similar way to light being refracted and reflected.  The effects scale with wavelength, but you can get exactly the same effects in mirrors, blocks of transparent (to light or RF) material, lenses and waveguides (or light fibers) with RF and light or infra-red.  The scale difference is huge.  Light is around 0.5 of a micrometer wavelength, microwaves are a few centimeters, AM radio is perhaps 300 meters wavelength.  They can all be treated as waves or as photons, and quantum mechanics applies just the same to them all. When you put a pencil in a fishtank, it seems to bend. That same refraction happens with radio waves, they travel more slowly in dielectrics than in a vacuum because of the quantum effects, but that doesn't matter for large objects like these. A slanting dielectric surface can bend the rays of light or radio energy.  If the slanted surface is in the shape of a curved magnifying glass, the amount of bending varies across the glass, with more bending at the edges, so a parallel beam of light like from the Sun gets focussed to a point.  Exactly the same happens with radio waves so long as the glass is more than ten wavelengths across and the source is emitting radio waves.  You might want to use PTFE or a similar RF-transparent plastic to make the lens as it's much clearer than glass at millimeter wavelengths.

Now instead of making the lens shaped like a magnifying glass, we can change the density of the material by putting larger holes (or more holes) in it to reduce its average density, varying that density across the body of the material.  If you pick the rate of change of density just right, the effect on mmWave energy is indistinguishable from that of the original magnifying glass shape, but it's way easier to make and mount.  You can also do really complex tapers of density that would be impossible to machine.
